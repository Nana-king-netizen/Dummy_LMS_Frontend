# DCIT_205_IA
# REDESIGNING THE UNIVERSITY OF GHANA COMPUTER SCIENCE WEBSITE.

## A Brief Introduction and Purpose of the Website

This is a 10 page redesign of the Department of Computer Science, University of Ghana. Each page is dedicated to each aspect of the department. It includes Home, About Us, contact Us, Admissiom, Academic course programs, Faculty, careers, executive, Libraries, and Research. This Interim Assessment was given to us to enable us apply all the understanding we have gathered in HTML, CSS, and if applicable Javascript and React. 

# Getting Started
**How To Clone and Setup the Project**

  1. Fork the repository
   A public repository is created, we must fork the repository to our own GITHUB account to begin working on the project.

  2. Clone the repository to your local machine
   https://github.com/Addyt09/11019725_DCIT205.git
   
   3. Use the right git command to add files, commit, and push those files to your remote repository after every significant change in the project.
   
   To add all untraked or modifying files, the command git add -A is used, to commit the command git commit -m is used and finally to push to github the command git push -u is used

   If the files to be commited have no significant change like untracked files and just need to be modified the command commit -a -m is used.

# What I have Learnt from the Project
  Creating a wesite requires creativity and also requires you pay attention to the syntax you are using in your files though in Web development it does not really require you to memories the syntax or the attritubes to be able to create a responsive website, especially since there are materials online to aids us in generating the required output we desire for our webpages.
